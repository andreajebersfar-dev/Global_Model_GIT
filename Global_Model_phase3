PROJECT: AI-Accelerated Global Model for Gridded Ion Thrusters (GIT)

DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to develop a machine learning surrogate model for the plasma 
dynamics inside a Gridded Ion Thruster.

PHASES:
1.  Physics Solver (Ground Truth): 
    Replication of the 0D Global Model described in the paper:
    'Global model of a gridded-ion thruster powered by a radiofrequency inductive coil'
    (Chabert et al., DOI: 10.1063/1.4737114).

2.  Dataset Generation: 
    Creation of a synthetic dataset by sweeping input parameters (RF Power, Mass Flow) 
    and simulating steady-state results using the physics solver.

3.  ML Surrogate Model: 
    Training a Neural Network to approximate the system of differential equations, 
    enabling real-time inference.

4.  Dashboard: 
    Development of a Streamlit interface for interactive performance analysis.
