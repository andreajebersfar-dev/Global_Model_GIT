Physics-based simulation and machine learning surrogate model for a RF gridded ion thruster, enabling real-time performance prediction and inverse design optimization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end pipeline for modeling and optimizing a Gridded Ion Thruster (GIT):

Physics simulation → dataset generation → neural surrogate model → interactive engineering dashboard

The goal is to replace expensive plasma simulations with a fast surrogate model capable of:

- real-time thrust prediction
- exploration of the thruster operating parameter space
- inverse optimization 

The physics model is based on:

> Global model of a gridded-ion thruster powered by a radiofrequency inductive coil  
> Chabert et al., Physics of Plasmas (2012)  
> DOI: 10.1063/1.4737114

# ⚛️ Phase 1 — 0D Global Model (Physics Solver)

Physics-based ground truth solver for the plasma inside the discharge chamber.

## Overview

Implements a zero-dimensional global plasma model that solves coupled ODEs describing:

- plasma density  
- neutral density  
- electron temperature  
- gas temperature  

The solver integrates until steady-state and is used as:

- ground truth generator  
- validation baseline  
- dataset generator for ML model  

### State Variables

- `n` — plasma density (m⁻³)  
- `ng` — neutral gas density (m⁻³)  
- `Te` — electron temperature (eV)  
- `Tg` — neutral gas temperature (K)  

### Simulation Routines

**Power Sweep**

RF Power: 100 → 1600 W  
Used to validate behavior against literature.

**Mass Flow Optimization**

Mass flow: 0.5 → 40 mg/s  
Finds saturation where:

```
Ion current density → Child-Langmuir limit
```

### Outputs

Two analysis dashboards with key figures:

- ion current density vs power  
- densities vs power  
- temperatures vs power  
- thrust components  
- efficiency metrics  
- thrust vs mass flow

# 📊 Phase 2 — Synthetic Dataset Generation

Transforms physics simulations into a dataset for ML training.

## Goal

Generate 5,000 operating points across the thruster envelope.

**Why:**
- physics solver = slow (seconds per run)  
- ML requires large dataset  
- enables real-time prediction later  

## Techniques

### Latin Hypercube Sampling
Ensures uniform coverage of parameter space.

Ranges:
- RF Power: 50 → 2500 W  
- Mass flow: 0.5 → 40 mg/s  

### Parallel Computing
Uses Python multiprocessing:
- splits workload across CPU cores  
- near-linear speedup  
- reduces runtime from hours to minutes  

## Output Dataset
